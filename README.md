# 🏦 Multi-Chain Real Yield Token (MRYT)

📌 **MRYT (Multi-Chain Real Yield Token)** is a Solana-based **yield-bearing token** that distributes DeFi revenue to stakers. This protocol allows users to stake **LP tokens** to earn real yield, not inflationary emissions.

## 🚀 **Features**
✅ **Stake LP Tokens** – Users deposit LP tokens into the vault and receive MRYT in return.  
✅ **Real Yield Accrual** – The protocol generates yield from DeFi activities.  
✅ **Auto-Compounding** – A portion of yield is automatically reinvested to maximize long-term returns.  
✅ **Sybil-Resistant** – Prevents large withdrawals by enforcing caps and vesting.  
✅ **Flash Loan-Proof** – New deposits are locked for **7 days** to prevent exploits.  
✅ **Dynamic APY Calculation** – The system dynamically calculates the **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)** based on accrued rewards.
